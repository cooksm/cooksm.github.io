        	<p>The Cook Research Group at the University of Colorado-Boulder specializes in the design and development of sustainable water systems. Our group uses experimentation, biological process modeling, and life cycle impact assessments in order to examine and improve the sustainability of wastewater and drinking water systems by determining the operational limits of biological treatment systems, advancing technologies that recover resources from waste, and integrating environmental and economic factors into the design and decision-making processes. </p>
			
			<p>Our group is led by Assistant Professor Sherri Cook. Dr. Cook joined the Civil, Environmental and Architectural Engineering Department at the University of Colorado Boulder as an Assistant Professor in the Environmental Engineering program in August 2014. She received her MSE and PhD in Environmental Engineering from the University of Michigan in 2009 and 2014, respectively. Prior to that, she received her BS in Civil Engineering from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (Virginia Tech) in 2008.
