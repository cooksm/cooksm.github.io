        	<p>My research promotes the design and development of sustainable water systems. 
        	   Using models for biological processes, coupled with sustainability tools like life cycle assessment and 
        	   life cycle costing, my research takes a systems perspective in order to identify the most crucial components 
        	   and best ways to improve a system’s performance. Building on this research approach and application of tools, 
        	   I will investigate the stability of biological treatment processes, explore resource recovery methods to determine 
        	   appropriate applications, and evaluate the synergies of a closed water treatment system.

			<h4>Strategic resource recovery.</h4>
			As resources become limited and costs increase, recovering the nutrients and 
			energy in wastewaters and solid wastes is becoming an expectation of waste management systems. There are many 
			existing and emerging approaches to recover these resources, such as algal growth for biodiesel and biochar 
			from biosolids, but waste management systems need guidance on choosing approaches that are most likely to meet 
			their objectives. I intend to evaluate the benefits and limitations of these processes by modeling ideal 
			systems and case studies along with experimentally evaluating the methods. This research will support the strategic applications of these methods by creating the information needed to successfully choose which works best for a community’s environment, economy, and culture.

<h4>Stable operating boundaries of environmental biotechnology systems. </h4>
With more regulations on new contaminants and nutrients, our biological processes will be increasingly operating at their limits. To understand the performance capabilities and limitations of biological treatment systems, I will be defining their functional operating spaces. Since these spaces can be dependent on many factors, such as microbial population, I intend to investigate the dynamics of a system’s functional operating space by modeling and by leading or collaborating on experimental work. For anaerobic systems, my research work will include the impact of reactor configuration on performance capabilities and the impact of a microbial community’s experience with shock loadings on the dynamics of a functional operating space. My research will allow me to evaluate new and proposed biotechnology systems and support reliability-based optimizations. Research in this area will improve our understanding of a technology’s stable operation so we can design reliable treatment systems and optimize them without increasing the risk of failure.

<h4>Safely and efficiently closing the water treatment cycle.</h4>
 In the past, we have viewed drinking water and wastewater treatment as separate systems, but we are now moving towards viewing an entire water treatment cycle. When these treatment systems are closely linked on spatial and temporal scales, the failure of any treatment process can result in a public health risk. My research will focus on evaluating and improving the reliability and efficiency of these linked treatment systems in order to minimize impacts to human and environmental health. I will examine how these systems interface with each other to identify and understand the positive and negative synergies from the various technologies employed. A systems-level approach allows me to evaluate the entire water treatment cycle as well as the specifics of the individual drinking water and wastewater systems so I can both find the problems we will encounter and the best solutions that result in reliable and efficient water management that  protects public health.
